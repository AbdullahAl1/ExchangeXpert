###  CExchangeXpert is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React library](https://reactjs.org/) for building user interfaces. React allows us to develop efficient and scalable front-end applications with its component-based architecture, making it ideal for real-time data updates and complex UI designs.
- Our AI and machine learning models are implemented using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). TensorFlow is an open-source library used for building and deploying machine learning models, while Scikit-learn offers efficient tools for data analysis and model training.
